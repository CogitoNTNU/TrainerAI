### About 
-----
This is a template README for projects by Cogito NTNU.   

Here's the introduction about goal and summary of the project.
### Getting started
------

#### Prerequisites
In this section you put what is needed for the program to run.
For example: OS version, programs, libraries, etc.  

We'll be running Docker.
- You require Docker to be installed on your machine if you're building the images yourself.

#### Installation
In this Section you describe how to install this project in its intended environment.(i.e. how to get it to run)  

cd into your chosen project folder. Make sure there's a compose.yaml file there.
Run this in your terminal (Granted you have [Docker]([url](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)) on your system)
```
Docker compose up
```
If you make any code changes, remember to run
```
Docker compose build
```
before 'compose up' as the 'up' command doesn't rebuild the images.

#### Usage
------
In this section you describe how to use the program to obtain the desired result.  

### Architecture
We're using 4 backend services.
Mongodb server - Running on port 27017 - providing storage for chatlogs
Timeseries analysis - Running a python flask server, using tensorflow
LLM service - Running a python flask server, using langchain
Main endpoint : Nodejs - Providing static file hosting for the user interface, as well as rerouting to other services via API calls. 

#### Why do you route everything via Node, instead of calling the flask servers directly?
This way we can host everything on one machine, WITHOUT worrying about CORS.
1: CORS issues arise when a website tries to access information from a different domain than the one it's hosted on. This is a server issue, and can be fixed by allowing CORS, but is complexity we don't need right now.
2: By only having one endpoint, we can host this on a machine, with only one domain-name. Multiple direct endpoints would require multiple domain names to access, as they would be different servers. This requires setting up a load-balancer, which is not interest of the project.
